`ACANA` is a social Q&A platform that combines the RAG system for learning, similar to the Chinese community's Zhihu. However, as time goes by, there are more and more posts on such websites, and it used to be difficult to quickly obtain the required information through simple keyword searches. Therefore, `ACANA` can enhance the platform's search and knowledge generation capabilities by integrating LLM capabilities into the RAG system, ultimately achieving the goal of improving user learning efficiency.

Usually, this is also a project used for learning with Go.
Currently in the development stage, the technologies planned to be used are as follows: web part: `Golang`, `MySQL` (user&connect store), `Redis`, `Zap` (logger record), `Viper` (config manager), `gin` (web frame); RAG section: `langchaingo`, `weaviate` (vector database).
